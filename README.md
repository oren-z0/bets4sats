## Sell tickets for bets on competitions and send back rewards with ease

Bets4Sats alows you to make tickets for bets on competitions.
Each user chooses an option to bet on, fills a lightning-address to receive the
winning reward, and sends an amount of sats.
When the competition ends, the app-manager selects the option that won, and all
the rewards will be sent automatically from the wallet to the winners' lightning
addresses, proportionally to the size of their bets.
The app manager keeps 1% of the rewards. Lightning fees are deducted from the users.

Bets4Sats includes a shareable ticket scanner, which can be used to find the tickets
in case of disputes.

## Usage

1. Create a new competition\

   - minimum bet and maximum bet for each ticket
